      <description>Introduction This blog will detail the process I used to complete the fourth lab for CIT 480, in which I configured an AWS EC2 instance to allow communication with an AWS simple storage system bucket. For the most part I thought this lab was pretty straight forward but I did have a minor hiccup which I will detail in a later section.

The other is my regular AWS account, which although it does not have any education credits is still within its, first year granting me free tier access to resources.</description>
