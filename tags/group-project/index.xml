      <description>Introduction This blog I will be detailing the process I went through to acquire a domain and a TLS certificate to allow HTTPS traffic. This will be the first part in a potential multipart series going through my tasks in the CIT 481 semester-long group project. I was put in charge of Domain and Certificate Acquisition as I was the one with the most experience with domains.
