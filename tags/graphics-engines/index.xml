      <description>Introduction Although I thought I had little to discuss last blog regarding CIT, this week has been even less productive. While I have made progress in my computer science class, it was involving yet another HTML/CSS project. I have chosen to not talk about the same topic two postings in a row. Perhaps I will revisit the content of that class when we move on to browser scripts. This week beyond that I have been attending to my other non-major classes, so I have little to talk about that is both scholastic and technical. As a result, I will go over a personal project I recently did that does fit the technical aspect but not the scholastic one.</description>
