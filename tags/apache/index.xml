      <description>Introduction This blog will act as a sort of &amp;ldquo;Housekeeping&amp;rdquo; in terms of project progress not much has changed since last I wrote. However several small changes have been made, and I think it would be fitting to make a blog post on the various minute details regarding the senior design project. While individually they are insignificant, together they are not.
Ansible Refactor In a previous blog post, I talked about our Web Stack automating Ansible playbook. In the range of time between this post and that one some changes have been made. To briefly recap, our first version of the Ansible Script as of Project 0&amp;rsquo;s completion installed Apache, PHP, mySQL, and pulled the Git repository holding our sample web app.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this blog I will go over my recent endeavors in Computer Science 424. For this assignment we needed to build Apache from source and ensure our host operating system could view the website in a standard web browser. Several configuration changes must also be made during build. This includes:
 Multi-Processing Multi-threading  As these are not on by default we must build from source to have a version of Apache that suits our needs This assignment was very open-ended and involved reading documentation to discover a way of accomplishing the task. As a result, the conclusions I came to may not be the most efficient nor the recommended practice.</description>

      <description>Introduction This blog I will be detailing the process I went through to acquire a domain and a TLS certificate to allow HTTPS traffic. This will be the first part in a potential multipart series going through my tasks in the CIT 481 semester-long group project. I was put in charge of Domain and Certificate Acquisition as I was the one with the most experience with domains.
Domain Choice Being poor college students, we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to break the bank on our domain. However, we still wanted it to be related to our team, to make it easily distinguishable. With those prerequisites in mind, I went searching several domain registrar websites to find a cheap year long domain license.</description>
