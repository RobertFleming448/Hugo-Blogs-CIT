      <description>Introduction In this blog I will record my issues and solutions I went through while trying to complete the first module of our CIT 481 Senior Design project.
Background Our team is undergoing an alternative project offered by the professor and we are tasked with using an Ansible playbook to automate building a tech stack on an AWS infrastructure. This infrastructure includes 3 private and 3 public subnets spanning across 3 separate availability zones. Each Availability zone must contain a private web server EC2 instance and a public SSH bastion Host EC2 instance. I will focus on the computing resources in this blog and less so on the VPC as that was a lesser role of mine.</description>

      <description>Introduction This blog I will be detailing the process I went through to acquire a domain and a TLS certificate to allow HTTPS traffic. This will be the first part in a potential multipart series going through my tasks in the CIT 481 semester-long group project. I was put in charge of Domain and Certificate Acquisition as I was the one with the most experience with domains.
Domain Choice Being poor college students, we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to break the bank on our domain. However, we still wanted it to be related to our team, to make it easily distinguishable. With those prerequisites in mind, I went searching several domain registrar websites to find a cheap year long domain license.</description>
