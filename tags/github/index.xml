      <description>Introduction Since I have already completed the assignments thus far for CIT 480, I find myself at a lack of content to construct this blog about. As a result, I feel itâ€™s appropriate to move into a more COMP 484 related direction. In this blog I will go over my first HTML/CSS Project for COMP 484 and the requirements/how I accomplished them.
Requirements The project was simple, we had to construct an HTML website with 4 pages and a stylesheet. Since we were allowed to pick any topic we wanted. I chose the video game franchise, The Legend of Zelda as I was certain I could fill 4 pages with content.</description>
