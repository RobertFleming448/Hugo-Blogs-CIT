      <description>Introduction As we start a fresh semester, I find a fresh set of visuals will help keep things interested. As such, my blogs now have a sleek minimalistic design using the Hugo Fuji theme. Yes you read that right. My blog will now be using Hugo. For my previous blogs that I wrote during my semester in CIT 480, I used a similar static site generator called Jekyll. While it did the job, I by no means used all its features to their best extent, and I overall was not too fond of it. That is why I decided to use Hugo from this point forward.</description>
