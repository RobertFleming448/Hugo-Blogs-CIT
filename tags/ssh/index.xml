      <description>Introduction In this blog I will record my issues and solutions I went through while trying to complete the first module of our CIT 481 Senior Design project.
Background Our team is undergoing an alternative project offered by the professor and we are tasked with using an Ansible playbook to automate building a tech stack on an AWS infrastructure. This infrastructure includes 3 private and 3 public subnets spanning across 3 separate availability zones. Each Availability zone must contain a private web server EC2 instance and a public SSH bastion Host EC2 instance. I will focus on the computing resources in this blog and less so on the VPC as that was a lesser role of mine.</description>

      <description>Introduction For this blog I will be going over my process and reasoning for creating a Minecraft Server with a Raspberry Pi 4. This is one of the topics I have saved for moments that are somewhat slow this semester. While I have been working diligently on other projects, the content is not substantial enough to fill an entire blog. As a result, I will keep it on the backburner until I feel suitable progress has been made.
Reasoning During this pandemic, I find interacting with friends online to be a more pressing matter. Without avenues to interact with my peers, I would surely go mad.</description>
